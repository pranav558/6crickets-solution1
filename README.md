1. Angular coding problem
There is an API endpoint called /api/deadline which returns { secondsLeft: number } JSON object containing the number of seconds left to some constant deadline date (deadline date never changes). Write an Angular component (and any other Angular classes/functions if needed) that will retrieve data from backend and will display “Seconds left to deadline: X” countdown timer (X should be updated every second). Please take your time to write performance optimized code that could be then copy-pasted into some bigger Angular project.

General coding problem
[The author of this story problem is neither a photographer nor a hardware engineer, so please forgive any implausibility.] Suppose we want to construct a versatile software camera by combining many inflexible hardware cameras. Each hardware camera works well for a particular range of subject distances and for a particular range of light levels. The software camera will measure the light level and subject distance of each shot and choose an appropriate hardware camera to capture it. There are many hardware cameras on the market, and we are considering various proposals for which ones to include in our design. Write a function that takes the desired characteristics of the software camera (range of subject distances and range of light levels that it should support) and a list of hardware cameras with their respective characteristics, and tests whether that set of hardware cameras will suffice.
Feel free to write your solution in any programming language you prefer. The purpose of this problem is to test your analytical skills, please do not build user interface for general problem. Do not use any third party library or framework. Provide your code in a single file if possible.
