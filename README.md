This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.2.

1. Angular coding problem
There is an API endpoint called /api/deadline which returns { secondsLeft: number } JSON object containing the number of seconds left to some constant deadline date (deadline date never changes). Write an Angular component (and any other Angular classes/functions if needed) that will retrieve data from backend and will display “Seconds left to deadline: X” countdown timer (X should be updated every second). Please take your time to write performance optimized code that could be then copy-pasted into some bigger Angular project.
